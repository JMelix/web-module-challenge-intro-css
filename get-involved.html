Our vision is to help YOSAR continue as a world-class search and rescue organization.</p>

        <p class="paraStyle">Friends of Yosemite Search and Rescue (FOYOSAR) provides additional training funds, helps coordinate with YOSAR in securing grants, and provides public outreach and education materials regarding safety in Yosemite National Park. All donations made to FOYOSAR are administered through an independent board. The board is made up of present/former YOSAR team members and other advisors who have worked in and around Yosemite National Park as administrators, medical professionals, and rescue personnel. Donations have allowed team members to receive stipends to attend medical and technical trainings, have provided for improvements to facilities and mobile command units, helped establish a training endowment to support the future additional training needs of rescue personnel, and provided the means of maintaining this website to provide more timely information on incidents in Yosemite National Park.</p>
